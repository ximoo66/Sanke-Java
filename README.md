# Final Project

Snake Game:
The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat red dots (food) to grow in length and score points. However, the player must avoid colliding with the snake's own body and the screen edges. The game offers different modes, including Normal, Survival, and Story modes.

Key Features:

    Main Menu:
        Start Button: Initiates the game in Normal mode.
        How to Play Button: Provides instructions on how to play the game.
        Exit Button: Exits the game.
        Story Mode Button: Initiates the game in Story mode.
        Survival Mode Button: Initiates the game in Survival mode.
        Toggle Button: Toggles the background of the game on and off.

    Gameplay:
        The snake is controlled using arrow keys or WASD.
        The snake grows longer by eating red dots.
        Colliding with the snake's body or screen edges results in a game over.
        In Survival mode, the snake's speed increases over time.
        In Story mode, the player progresses through levels with increasing difficulty and added obstacles.
